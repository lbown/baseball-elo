This is generated without removing closing pitchers from the game. The distribution of pitchers is heavily skewed right using the blind method. The play-by-play statistics for these closers don't agree with the high ratings that the closers are getting. Closing pitchers are substituted in games when the team they are playing for is already ahead, so they are much more likely to win. Our blind method is artifically boosting the ratings of closers.
